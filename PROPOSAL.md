Put your final project proposal here.

I plan to build a music visualizer using c++ and cinder. It will be able to input a song, run a series of analysis on that song, and create a colorful visualization that plays alongside the song. As of now I plan to use the frequencies of the music and do a aesthetically pleasing realtime graph.

I have been interested in music visualization for a long time as it has been a long time goal to make a music visualization for LEDs similar to what is seen at concerts. I have created a very primitive version of this using python so I have a vision of how it could be done well in c++.

As a rough time line, by the first week I could get the music done such as understanding how to input, analyse, and play music concurrently with cinder.
For the second week, I could figure out how to code the minimum music analysis and concurrent graph. 
For the final week I could try to figure out how to make it look good including changing colors or variable shapes that make it look better.

If i was to finish this project early I could do a strech goal of trying to implement it in a non-linear fashion such as having different shapes or styles of gradients or changing math equations.
